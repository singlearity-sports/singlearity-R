# T is a 28x28 matrix with transition probabilities from one state to another
# T_(i,j) gives the probability of going from state i to state j
# The sum of all transition probabilities in a given row must equal 1

# This is the most simple form of a Markov chain: 
# - every batter has the same transition matrix
# - can't score on an out (very naive assumption)
# - doesn't differentiate between inning-ending base-out states
# - assumes only six offensive outcomes possible:
# -- out (no advancing), BB, 1B, 2B, 3B, HR
